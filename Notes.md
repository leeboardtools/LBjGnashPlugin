# TODO

- Need to support exporting of the date in columns, actually the main column is the date,
and it contains sub-columns. Currently ignoring the main column if there are sub-columns.
See Securities export.

- Add portfolio report option that displays securities directly as the rows, not
as children of accounts.

- Add ability to filter on Account notes (want to be able to add say 'real-estate' as a note,
and then exclude accounts with notes that contain 'real-estate'.

- Add format for column dates to reports.
