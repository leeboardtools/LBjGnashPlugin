# TODO

- Add portfolio report option that displays securities directly as the rows, not
as children of accounts.

- Add ability to filter on Account notes (want to be able to add say 'real-estate' as a note,
and then exclude accounts with notes that contain 'real-estate'.

- Add format for column dates to reports.
